# Sonic Cartographer Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Sonic Cartographer backend, automatically generated by the Raindrop Framework during initial project setup.

## Overview

Sonic Cartographer transforms music discovery from algorithmic recommendation into guided exploration through AI-powered listener analysis. The system analyzes a user's listening history to create a "listener portrait" and enables conversations about musical taste that lead to curated album recommendations.
